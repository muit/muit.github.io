Now that the main points on my implementation of an array are covered on [the previous post](making-your-own-array-optimizations.md), I can jump into more specific topics.

In this post lets talk about the different optimizations this design has enabled.

#### Prevent copy of trailing elements when reallocating

#### Reallocate data pointer as a bigger block

#### Remove Swap and its variations

#### Sorting operations

Until next time, Muit.
