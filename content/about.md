Hi!

I'm **Miguel**, also known as **muit**.

The majority of my work is centered around the design and implementation of videogame systems and tools in C++. If you like code, stay around and have a look!

Many of these projects are **open-source** and can be found at [**Piperift**](https://github.com/piperift)
