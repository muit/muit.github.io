Hi!

I'm Miguel, also known as muit.<br>
Game programmer & voice actor.

The majority of my work in videogames is centered around the design and implementation of videogame systems and tools in C++. If you like to code, stick around and have a look at my [posts](./posts)!

Many of my projects are open-source and can be found at [Piperift](https://github.com/piperift). Currently working at CI Games, previously Ubisoft Stockholm, EA DICE & Splash Damage.

If you want to chat, just drop me an email!<br>
