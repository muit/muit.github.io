Well, specifically, about how we query entities, manage dependencies and access/modify data. What is ECS you ask? Fair question! ECS (as Entity-Component-System) is an architectural pattern based on DOD (data-oriented design), where you have three main elements:
Entities: They are just an identifier and don’t hold any data. Components: Structs of data associated with a single entity (1 entity can have 1 component of each type).</description></item><item><title>Implementing a general-use arena</title><link>https://muit.tech/drafts/posts/2022/02/implementing-a-general-use-arena/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muit.tech/drafts/posts/2022/02/implementing-a-general-use-arena/</guid><description>Now that we have learned about arenas and allocators, we can get our hands dirty with an implementation of an arena.
Best Fit Arena You see, for the last couple of months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating RiftCore with new features. RiftCore is a cross-platform framework I use for C++ projects, and it lacked some memory management.
So the time came to design a general-purpose arena!
This article will describe the design and implementation of a Best Fit Arena.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to allocators and arenas</title><link>https://muit.tech/drafts/posts/2021/03/introduction-to-allocators-and-arenas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muit.tech/drafts/posts/2021/03/introduction-to-allocators-and-arenas/</guid><description>Lately, I have been playing around with the implementation of custom allocators and arenas to replace native allocations on my C++ projects. Wow! Stop right there, Miguel. This line already deserves some introductions! Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about allocators.
Crash course on allocations To keep this brief, I will assume that we have some experience with C++ and heap allocation (malloc and new).
An allocation is when we request a pointer to a block of memory of a specified size.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://muit.tech/drafts/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muit.tech/drafts/about/</guid><description>Hi!
I&amp;rsquo;m Miguel, also known as muit.
The majority of my work is centered around the design and implementation of videogame systems and tools in C++. If you like to code, stick around and have a look!
Most of my projects are open-source and can be found at Piperift. Currently working at Ubisoft Stockholm, previously EA DICE and Splash Damage.</description></item></channel></rss>
