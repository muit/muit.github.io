Best Fit Arena You see, for the last couple of months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating RiftCore with new features. RiftCore is a cross-platform framework I use for C++ projects, and it lacked some memory management.
So the time came to design a general-purpose arena!
This article will describe the design and implementation of a Best Fit Arena.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to allocators and arenas</title><link>https://muit.xyz/drafts/posts/memory-introduction-to-allocators-and-arenas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muit.xyz/drafts/posts/memory-introduction-to-allocators-and-arenas/</guid><description>Lately, I have been playing around with the implementation of custom allocators and arenas to replace native allocations on my C++ projects.
Wow! Stop right there, Miguel. This line already deserves some introductions! Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about allocators.
Crash course on allocations To keep this brief, I will assume that we have some experience with C++ and heap allocation (malloc and new).
An allocation is when we request a pointer to a block of memory of a specified size.</description></item></channel></rss>
